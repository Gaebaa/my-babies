    <p>They be acting like they own the house and pay the bills. Bobby(right) was born on June 1st 2021.
      We do not know when Rono was born but it's a few weeks-a month earlier than Bobby. So, we decide that both of them will be celebrating their birthdays on June 1st. </p>

      <p> In the year and few months Bobby has been with us, he has broken a total of 2 computer mouse, 2 different individuals out of different shoes, 3 dog beds, multiple hair claws and one and half furniture. After doing so he will show his work proudly by falling asleep next to them. We love him.
